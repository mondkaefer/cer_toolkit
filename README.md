CeR Toolkit Installer
===

Client tools offered by the Centre for eResearch at the University of Auckland, packed in an installer.

Currently only an installer for Windows is provided, which includes

* Command-line scripts and their dependencies from the [rjm repository](https://github.com/mondkaefer/rjm)
* A little script that opens a Windows commmand window which has all installed executables in the path
